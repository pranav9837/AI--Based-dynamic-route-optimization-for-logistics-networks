# 🚚 AI-Based Dynamic Route Optimization for Logistics Networks

An AI-powered web application that optimizes delivery routes dynamically using real-time traffic data and advanced algorithms. Designed for logistics networks to reduce fuel costs, improve delivery time, and handle real-world constraints like vehicle limits and delivery windows.

## 🔍 Features

- 🚦 Real-time dynamic route optimization
- 🧠 AI engine using Genetic Algorithms & Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- 🌐 Live traffic and map data integration (Google Maps API)
- 📊 Dashboard for route visualization and performance stats
- ⚙️ Constraint handling (time windows, vehicle limits)
- 🧱 Scalable for small and large delivery fleets

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Leaflet.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **APIs**: Google Maps API, OpenStreetMap
- **Algorithms**: Genetic Algorithm, Dijkstra's
